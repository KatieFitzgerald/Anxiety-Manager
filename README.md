## Anxiety Manager Android App

*DIT Computer Science Final Year Project*

According to St. Patrick’s Mental Health Services, “anxiety disorders are the most common mental health issue affecting the population of Ireland”. Generally, the key to overcoming anxiety is learning about your own anxiety cycle, by tracking moods, symptoms, triggers and reactions, then using that knowledge to break the cycle. Currently, tracking anxiety involves bulky workbooks that are invasive and difficult to fill out.

Anxiety Manager looks to replace the current process of tracking anxiety with quick, private questionnaires contained in an Android app. Along with automatic tracking of anxiety attacks, through sensors monitoring changes in heart rate and sweat levels (common anxiety symptoms). These sensors reduce the pressure on users to document their attacks as soon as they happen, rather allowing them to fill out questionnaires in their own time.

From this tracking, users can get visual insights into their own anxiety attacks, which traditional methods lack. Insights include most common location, the correlation between mood and reaction and the frequent triggers of anxiety attacks. Anxiety Manager also allows healthcare professionals to receive these insights about their patients.
