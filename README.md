## Anxiety Manager Android App

*DIT Computer Science Final Year Project*

The purpose of this project is to give all users a way of observing their physical symptoms, moods and thoughts associated with anxiety attacks. The problem this project challenges is automating the tracking of an individual’s anxiety. By tracking moods, thoughts and symptoms of anxiety attacks, the correct anxiety management practices for an individual can be applied. The project will use wearable sensors, such as pulse or skin response sensors, to detect the physical symptoms of a user’s anxiety. The sensors allow autonomous tracking of anxious situations (through physical symptoms) in the app. The developed system will give users an easy mobile system with minimal inputs to track anxious situations detected by sensors in their daily lives and a way for health care professionals to track their clients progress.
