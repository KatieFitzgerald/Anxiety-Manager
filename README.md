## Anxiety Manager Android App

*DIT Computer Science Final Year Project*

The purpose of this project is to give all types of users a non-invasive way of observing physical symptoms, moods and thoughts associated with anxiety. The problem this project challenges is automating the tracking of an individual’s anxiety to ensure the correct anxiety management practices for any given individual. The project will use wearable sensors, such as pulse or skin response sensors, to detect the physical symptoms of a user’s anxiety. The sensors will allow autonomous tracking of anxious situations (through physical symptoms). The developed system will give users an easy mobile system with minimal inputs to track anxious situations in their daily lives and a way for health care professionals to track their clients progress.
